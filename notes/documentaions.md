**We are going to use the BETTY Documentation Style for this project :-**
**We def. the vars first in the top of the file then assigent it**
**Every file end with new line**
**Betty check run after wrting the file**

**Vars namming**: The var's name should described what its, if the name is to long we write:
ex: char *the_full_name = "Ahmed Basher Abd All";

**Function namming**: The function's name should described what its, if the name is to long we write:
ex: int sum_of_two_number(int number_1, int number_2);

**File namming**: The same 


**API Documentation**: Write clear documentation for your printf-like function. Describe its parameters, return values, and usage examples. Include information on supported format specifiers and any additional features you implement.

for Function:
/**
 * int_index - Searches for an integer in an array.
 *
 * @array: The array to search in.
 * @size: The number of elements in the array.
 * @cmp: A pointer to the comparison function to be used.
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function searches for an integer in the given array by applying the
 *   provided comparison function to each element. It returns the index of the
 *   first element for which the comparison function does not return 0.
 *
 *   If no element matches, the function returns -1.
 *   If the size is less than or equal to 0, the function also returns -1.
 *
 * Return: Index of the first matching element, or -1 if no match is found.
*/

for Struct: 
/**
 * struct op - Struct op
 *
 * @op: The operator
 * @f: The function associated
*/


**Code Comments**: Use comments generously within your code to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of your implementation. This will make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and maintain the code.

ex: some_code; /* some_code do this and that */

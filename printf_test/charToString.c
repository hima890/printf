/**
 * charToString - Converts a character to a dynamically allocated string.
 *
 * @character: The character to be converted to a string.
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function takes a single character and converts it into a dynamically
 *   allocated string. The resulting string contains the character followed by
 *   a null-terminator.
 *
 *   The function allocates memory for the character and the null-terminator,
 *   and sets the character at the first position in the string.
 *
 *   If memory allocation fails, the function returns NULL.
 *
 * Return: A dynamically allocated string containing the character, or NULL on failure.

/**
* appendToCharBuffer - Appends a string to an existing character buffer.
*
* @buffer: A pointer to the character buffer to which the string
* will be appended.
* @str_to_append: The string that will be appended to the buffer.
*
* Description:
*   This function takes an existing character buffer
* (allocated using `malloc` or similar)
*   and appends the specified string to it. It checks
* for valid input and available space
*   in the buffer before appending. If there's enough
* space, the string is concatenated to the end of the buffer.
* If the `buffer` is `NULL`, the function returns the
* `buffer` as is.
*
*   If there's insufficient space in the buffer to append
* the string, the function reallocates
*   the buffer and appends the string.
*
*   The caller is responsible for managing memory,
* including freeing the buffer when it is no longer needed.
*
* Return: A pointer to the updated character
* buffer if the append operation is successful,
*         or NULL in case of an error in reallocation.
